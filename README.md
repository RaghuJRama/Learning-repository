Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.

Without blank lines, this might not look right.
# Heading
Don't do this!

# Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents now on.

## Paragraph Best Practices

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your pragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

    This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.

# Line Breaks

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

## Line Break Best Practices

First line with two spaces after.  
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.

First line with a backslash after.\
And the next line.

First line with nothing after.
And the next line.
