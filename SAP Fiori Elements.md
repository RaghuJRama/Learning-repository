# SAP Fiori Elements

- Develop apps using SAP Fiori elements and benefit from a template- and metadata-driven approach.
- SAP Fiori elements provides designs for UI patterns and predefined floorplans for common application use cases. App developers can use SAP Fiori elements to create SAP Fiori applications based on OData services and annotations that don't need JavaScript UI coding. 
- The resulting app uses predefined views and controllers that are provided centrally. This means no application-specific view instances are required. 
- SAPUI5 interprets metadata and annotations of the underlying OData service and uses the corresponding views for the SAP Fiori app at startup.

## Using SAP Fiori Elements Floorplans

Our floorplans provide you with predefined templates for common application use cases.
You can create apps using the following SAP Fiori elements floorplans

- List Report and Object Page
    - SAP Fiori elements contains predefined templates for list reports and object pages. A list report lets users filter, view, and work with items (objects) organized in list (table) format. The list report is typically used in conjunction with an object page. This object page lets users work with objects, providing functions for viewing, editing, and creating objects.
- Worklist
    - A worklist displays a collection of items to be processed by the user. There is no need for sophisticated filtering. Working through the item list usually involves reviewing details of the list items and taking action. In most cases, the user has to either complete a work item or delegate it.
- Overview Pages
    - An overview page is a data-driven SAP Fiori app for organizing large amounts of information. Information is visualized in a card format in an attractive and efficient way. Different cards are used for different types of content. The user-friendly experience makes viewing, filtering, and acting on data quick and easy. While presenting the big picture, business users can focus on the most important tasks enabling faster decision making as well as immediate action.
- Analytical List Page
    - The analytical list page (ALP) offers a unique way to analyze data step by step from different perspectives, to investigate a root cause through drilldown, and to act on transactional content. You can use SAP Fiori elements to build apps that require visualization and reporting of data using filters, interactive charts, and other data points such as KPIs (key performance indicators).
